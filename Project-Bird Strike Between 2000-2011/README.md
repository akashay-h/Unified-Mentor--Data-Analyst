# Bird Strike Analysis (2000-2011) - Power BI Project
# Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of bird strikes between the years 2000 and 2011. The project aims to provide key insights into the impact of bird strikes on airlines, aircraft, and aviation safety. Using Power BI, the data has been visualized to uncover trends, patterns, and critical incidents, offering a detailed breakdown of the associated costs and flight conditions.

# Objective
* Analyze bird strike incidents across airlines and their impacts on safety measures and costs.
* Evaluate key factors such as altitude, weather conditions, and flight phase during which bird strikes occur.
* Identify the top airlines affected and the cost incurred due to bird strikes.
* Provide actionable insights for aviation stakeholders to improve safety protocols and minimize risks.
  
# Key Metrics
* **Total Bird Strikes: 25.43K incidents**
* **Total Cost of Rebuilding: $142M**
* **Average Altitude: 799.03 feet**
* **Percentage of Strikes Below 1000 ft: 87.11%**
* **Percentage of Strikes Causing Damage: 9.65%**

# Dashboard Features

* **Yearly Breakdown**: Bird strikes visualized by year, highlighting peak years with the most incidents and highest costs.
* **Airline Analysis**: Top 10 airlines affected by bird strikes, with Southwest Airlines and American Airlines leading the chart.

* **Altitude & Damage**: Analysis of strikes by altitude, showing that most incidents occurred below 1000 ft, and breakdowns of damage caused.

* **Weather Condition Impact**: Visualizations of bird strikes based on weather conditions, such as rain, fog, and snow, with clear risk patterns identified.

* **Flight Phase Analysis**: Evaluation of bird strikes by flight phase (e.g., takeoff, approach), showing when the majority of incidents occurred.

# Technologies Used

* **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and data visualizations.
* **DAX**: Used for custom calculations and aggregating data.
* **Excel**: Data preparation and cleaning.
  
# Insights
* **Significant Risk at Low Altitudes**: 87.11% of bird strikes occurred below 1000 feet, presenting a high risk during takeoff and landing.

* **Top Airlines**: Airlines like Southwest Airlines and American Airlines reported the highest number of incidents, indicating the need for targeted safety improvements.

* **Weather Impact**: Bird strikes were more frequent during adverse weather conditions, particularly fog and rain, highlighting the need for enhanced risk management strategies during poor visibility.
